Use Swiftype external crawler engine for your search.

== Description ==

Swiftype is a service which allows you to replace the rather basic search engine of Wordpress with something a lot more powerful. The basic account is free: https://swiftype.com/users/sign_up

There is a lot of features as well: https://swiftype.com/site-search

Swiftype already has a Wordpress plugin, but it's simply sending of all your posts and pages to their engine. With this plugin you can use the external crawler. This is important in case that part of your website doesn't use Wordpress or if you want category (and other) archives included in search results. Our plugin is "read-only", ie. you need to setup the crawler in your Swiftype account and our plugin only connects to that.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. You will be asked to provide the API key. It needs to be your master account API key.
3. Once provided, you will be able to pick your engine. Make sure you pick the external crawler engine and not a Wordpress one (if you used the original Switftype Wordpress plugin before).
4. Done, check your search. There is a test mode as well as debug mode for your testing.
